# EC2

You can use free tier t2.micro ec2 instances to host your API endpoint for PoC or early development.  
See the [terraform README.md](..%2F..%2F..%2Fterraform%2FREADME.md) if you just want to get one up and running as
quickly as possible.

Otherwise you can ask ChatGPT or [Python API Generator](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-PRk40O4g9-python-api-generator)

```
show me how to set up an ec2 instance in AWS with my python fastapi app that is in a git repo and run on docker.
```   

and that should get you close.
